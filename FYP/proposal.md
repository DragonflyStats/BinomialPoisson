FYP proposal
=================

This project shall use Allometric models to estimate the growth of Sitka Spruce stands in Ireland. 

### Overview

The project shall be an appraisal of the forecasting models use to predict forestry growth.

### Data Sources

The student shall use measurement allometric data collect by Coillte, and compare these measurments data to 
model forecast estimates for each stand.

### Factors that influence disagreement in estimates

Of particular interest is the factors that give rise to divergence between model forecasts and observed measurements. 
These factors may include geographic location (in particular proximity of the western seaboard), soil type, location quality.

### Statistical Skill set

* This project is designed to enhance the student's ability with the R programming language, in particular the "Tidyverse" toolkit.

* Use of statistical procedures such as model diagnostics, measurement method comparison techniques, Standard ANOVA 
procedures and/or Linear mixed effects models shall be employed.
