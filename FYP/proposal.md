FYP proposal
=================

This project shall use Allometric models to estimate the growth of Sitka Spruce stands in Ireland. 

### Overview

The project shall be an appraisal of the forecasting models use to predict forestry growth.

### Data Sources

The student shall use measurement allometric data collect by Coillte, and compare these measurments data to 
model forecast estimates for each stand.

### Factors that influence disagreement in estimates

Of particular interest is the factors that give rise to divergence between model forecasts and observed measurements. 
These factors may include geographic location (in particular proximity of the western seaboard), soil type, location quality.

### Statistical and Programming Skill Set

* This project is designed to develope the student's ability with the R programming language, in particular the "Tidyverse" toolkit, best practice in coding and version control and reproducible research. This can be faciliated by research staff at Coillte

* Use of statistical procedures such as Standard ANOVA procedures and/or Linear mixed effects models, model diagnostics (Cook's distance, residual analysis), measurement method comparison techniques and multivariate techniques (i.e. Mahalanobis Distances, Multivariate outlier detection) shall be employed.

* Tthe project shall appraise the use of machine learning techniques (e.g. Random Forest) to determine if these approaches are suitable for predictive models of forestry data.
