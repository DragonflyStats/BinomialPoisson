LiDAR: ALS & TLS 
========================
Adrián Pascual & Sara Uzquiano


Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a proven approach to creating fast and accurate terrain models for applications in many types of industries.
The technology is based on a scanning laser combined with both GPS and inertial technology to create a three dimensional set of points 
(point cloud).

ALS/LiDAR is an active remote


sensing technology that measures


distance with reflected laser light.


•LiDAR: LIght Detection and Ranging or


Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging)


• 1st developed in 1960 by Hughes


Aircraft inc.


• Modern computers and DGPS make


it practical.


• Typically used in very accurate


mapping of topography.


• New technologies and applications


are currently being developed.
