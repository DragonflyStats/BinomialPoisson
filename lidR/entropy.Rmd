entropy
===========

A normalized Shannon vertical complexity index. The Shannon diversity index is a measure for quantifying diversity and is based on the number and frequency of species present. This index, developed by Shannon and Weaver for use in information theory, was successfully transferred to the description of species diversity in biological systems (Shannon 1948). Here it is applied to quantify the diversity and the evenness of an elevational distribution of LiDAR points. 
It makes bins between 0 and the maximum elevation. If there are negative value the function returns NA.
