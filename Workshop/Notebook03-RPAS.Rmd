Company: Geobit

#### Drones

* DroidWorks VM X4
* Mikrokopter MK8 Hexacopter
* DJI Phnatom 4 - Advanced

#### Pros and Cons of RPAS

* less reliability
* Lower Bad Weather Conditions
* Worse Quality of on-board sensors

* Discrete
* Easy Deployment
* Low Altitude Flight
* Low Risk for Humans
 
### Forest Analysis
* Combined operation with TLS


#### Ground Sample Distance (GSD)
In remote sensing, ground sample distance (GSD) in a digital photo (such as an orthophoto) of the ground from air or space is the distance between pixel centers measured on the ground. For example, in an image with a one-meter GSD, adjacent pixels image locations are 1 meter apart on the ground. GSD is a measure of one limitation to image resolution, that is, the limitation due to sampling.
GSD is also referred to as ground-projected sample interval (GSI) or ground-projected instantaneous field of view (GIFOV).


#### Mission Planning
* GSD
* Altitude AGL
* Front Side Overlap
* Flight Pattern and Orientation
* Boundaries and Void Areas
* Follow Terrain
* VLOS BVLOS (Visual Line of Sight v Beyond Visual Line of Sight) Regulation on Drone Piloting
