Site Index Curve Development
======================================
***Andr√©s Bravo-Oviedo***

Site index is a tool to determine the relative productivity of a particular site or location. Site index is the height of a "free to grow" tree of a given species at a base age on the site of interest. 
Common base ages include 25, 50, and 100, depending on the lifespan and common management practices for that species.

Site index curves can be used to estimate relative site quality from the average age and average total height of dominant and codominant trees on a particular site. Each tree species has its own set of site index curves.
